    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mazamorra is a traditional Colombian drink from the Andean zone of the country and very popular as a side dish to foods such as our wonderful bandeja paisa. It is typically accompanied with panela or guava paste.</p>
    <p>What is Mazamorra? It is simply corn cooked until it is very soft. Mazamorra is known as a drink, but to me it is more like a dessert and the "claro", the cooking liquid from the mazamorra, is what my grandmother called "sobremesa", or the drink after the meal.</p>
